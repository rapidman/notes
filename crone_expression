Cron expression is represented by six fields:

second, minute, hour, day of month, month, day(s) of week
(*) means match any

*/X means "every X"

? ("no specific value") - useful when you need to specify something in one of the two fields in which the character is allowed, but not the other. For example, if I want my trigger to fire on a particular day of the month (say, the 10th), but I don't care what day of the week that happens to be, I would put "10" in the day-of-month field and "?" in the day-of-week field.
